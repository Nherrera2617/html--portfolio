<h1>Nathaniel's Movie List</h1>
<h2>These are my top movies so far</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Royal Tenenbaums</h3>
<p>The amount of detail that Wes Anderson put into that movie in the back ground amazed me. It help keep the dialog simple to where little was needed due to the amount of back ground detial behind the charactor's.</p>
<h3>G.I. Blues</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Elvis Presley movie of all time. From the music , set design, and casting, all elements came together for one of the top movies that I could watch over and over.</p>
<h3>Mad Max: Fury Road</h3>
<p>This is one of the best action movies of all time for me. Geroge Miller just throws you into the world of Mad Max fromt he begining and doesnt stop. The movie did a great job of showing what its like living in a post-apocalyptic world where survival is not promised.</p>
